# Autosplitter for Factorio

Currently tested only against 1.1.30.58304.

In the current version there is no customatisation of splits. The timer starts when a player transitions from not being in a game to being in a game and then splits on:

- Automation research (which is done by hand)
- Logistics research (which is usually the first one done after automating red science)
- Steel Axe research (potentially making part of this useful for the steelaxe% run)
- Automation2 research (which is usually the first one requiring green science)
- Advanced Oil Processing research (which is usually the first one requiring blue science)
- Productivity module 3 reserach (which is usually the first one requiring purple science)
- Rocket Silo research (which is usually the last one)
- Nubmer of rockets launched changing from 0 to 1 (VICTORY!)


## TODO

Many things? But probably some basic configuration screen for starters.
